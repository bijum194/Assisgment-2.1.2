Assignment 2.2

1. Read multiple JSON files into a directory to convert into a dataset.
I have files text1, text2, text3 in the directory JSON.

setwd("user/Desktop/json")
temp = list.files(pattern= "text1")



2. Parse the following JSON into a data frame.
js<-'{
"name": null, "release_date_local": null, "title": "3 (2011)",
"opening_weekend_take": 1234, "year": 2011,
"release_date_wide": "2011-09-16", "gross": 59954
}'

title opening_weekend_take year release_date_wide gross
3 (2011)                 1234 2011        2011-09-16 59954

(2011) 1234 2011 2011-09-16- 

3. Write a script for Variable Binning using R.




2.3

1. Create an m x n matrix with replicate(m, rnorm(n)) with m=10 column vectors of n=10 elements each,
constructed with rnorm(n), which creates random normal numbers.
Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables) and perform an algebraic
operation on each element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element referred by the two
indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of creating
the solution and report the system time differences.
